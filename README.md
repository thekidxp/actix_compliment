# actix_compliment
First attempt at a emergency compliment app for rustbridge with a newer framework

- Shouldn't be too hard to start by talking about different ways to create routes and let people experiment with versions of hello world
- move to showing static assets
- using templating languages like handlebars
- random data for the templates
- w/e else from there.
